<h1>
  About "Writer's Block"
</h1>

<p>
  This site came about to beat the inability to produce new work due to lack of ideas or reduced creativity. "Writer's block" is defined by the wikipedia as...
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block">
    "...a condition, primarily associated with writing, in which an author loses the ability to produce new work, or experiences a creative slowdown. The condition ranges in difficulty from coming up with original ideas to being unable to produce a work for years. Throughout history, writer's block has been a documented problem."
  </blockquote></p>
<p>
  Professional writers often experience blocks. However this is also very common amongst students.
